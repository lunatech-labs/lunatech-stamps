 <h2 class="title">What is Stamps?</h2>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
  Stamps is a client-side templating library similar to Play! Framework's server-side Groovy templates,
  but on the client, in pure JavaScript.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Why not user server-side templates?</h3>
  
  <p>
   With server-side templates, you serve pages by loading data from the database, then produce HTML pages
   using templates, then ship those pages to the client. This has the following drawbacks:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li><p>
     Template-processing uses CPU time which can impact scaling. On the other hand, the clients often have
     multi-core CPUs doing nothing most of the time. We can distribute the cost of rendering pages to the clients.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>
     Generating pages on the server increases the bandwidth necessary to serve pages, since we're sending a lot
     of HTML that is generated from data we load from the database. If we can send the data directly to the client
     and the client can generate the HTML, we can gain on bandwidth to serve the pages.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>
     If you generate a list of items on the server using templates, it is hard to add elements to that list on
     the client using AJAX, because the rendering logic is on the server, which means you have to duplicate it
     on the client.
   </p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
   Add to that the fact that when doing AJAX, you always end up creating lots of HTML on the client using ad-hoc
   means, most of the time either DOM manipulation or using jQuery, and that leads to ugly clumsy code that is
   hard to maintain. This is the exact reason why the servers switched from that sort of rendering to templating
   long ago, which is still largely unused on the client, unfortunately.
  </p>

  <h3>What can client-side templates do for me?</h3>
  
  <p>
   In addition to all the benefits we already discussed, client-side templates bring a number of unique features
   that are not possible on server-side templates: 
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>
    Template expressions and statements written in JavaScript, and not a dreadful sub-language such as UEL or
    a third language such as Groovy (supposing the server is written in Java and the client in JavaScript).
   </p></li>
   <li><p>
    The ability to introduce dynamic elements in the template, such as futures (parts of the template whose rendering
    is delayed until a certain resource arrives from the server in the background) or timed updates (being able
    to re-render parts of a template at specific time intervals), or even being able to use template evaluation-time
    values at run-time (functions produced by the template, used in <i>onclick</i> handlers).
   </p></li>
   <li><p>
    Define new template tags for new behaviour, either programatically for complex behaviour, or declaratively by
    simply giving a name to a template part.
   </p></li>
   <li><p>
    Apply templates on a page automatically, or by invoking an API for dynamic updates.
   </p></li>
  </ul>
