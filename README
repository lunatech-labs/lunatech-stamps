Due to conflicts with Play! templates the tags are defined like this:

~{tag /} or ~{tag}{/tag}
!{ JS statements }!
^{ JS expressions inserted in the body }

Use a JSTemplates.Future instance to delay evaluation (right now only supported in the list tag).

See examples in /app/views/Application/index.html and /public/templates/t1.html
